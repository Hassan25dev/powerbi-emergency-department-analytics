# 🚑 Emergency Department Analytics – Power BI

An end-to-end Power BI project focused on analyzing hospital emergency department activity.
The dashboard transforms raw admissions data into operational insights to support decision-making around patient flow, waiting times, and service performance.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Analyze patient inflow by day and hour 
- ⏱️ Monitor average waiting times and congestion periods  
- 🏥 Compare admission vs. non-admission outcomes 
- ⚖️ Evaluate performance across emergency services 
- 📊 Track decision-oriented KPIs for operational management

## 📚 Project Source & Inspiration

This project is inspired by and adapted from the following open-source Power BI sample:

- Original repository: OBaz-DA4U – Power BI Emergency Admissions Sample
Source: https://github.com/datavitalyzer/OBaz-DA4U-PowerBI-ReportSample-Emergency-Admissions
 
The goal of this work was not to reproduce the dashboard, but to rebuild and reinterpret it with a strong focus on data modeling, ETL clarity, and business-oriented KPIs.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates core Business Intelligence and analytics concepts commonly used in real-world decision-support systems:

- Data modeling (fact & dimension tables)
- ETL workflows using Power Query  
- Business logic implementation with DAX measures
- Time-based analysis (hourly / daily patterns) 
- KPI design for operational decision-making 
- Dashboard storytelling and usability
